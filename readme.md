# One Finger Right Typing experiment.

Live Demo: https://fosteeco.github.io/one-finger-right/

If you move your fingers one key to the right on your keyboard it's like writing in a sipher.

You ever place your hands on your keyboard and realize you're one key off and you get unwanted letters on your screen. Well this website is for you because it is able to decipher that junk if you placed your fingers one key to the right.

The way the conversion is accomplished is by using a letterMap. They're just javascript objects that map a letter to the letter right of it on your keyboard. I was going to use a switch statement but this makes bi directional conversions much simpler. You don't have to rewrite an entire switch satement. Instead you can just swap the keys and values of one of the objects. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23013573/swap-key-with-value-in-object

Pretty neat.

This is a simple project.
